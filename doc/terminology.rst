   mock
   mocking
      A very useful paradigm to accelerate development and testing of your behaviour trees
      is to mock your robot with very simple stubs that provide the same ROS API as the real
      robot. The actual behaviour underneath that ROS API need only be very roughly connected
      to the real thing.

      .. note:: The key here is to test the decision making in your behaviour tree.

      In most cases this has very little to do with the kinematics, dynamics or sensor
      fidelity of a full simulation.

      Mocking the bits and pieces takes far less time and you'll also be able to
      insert handles that can help you force decision making to
      branch to where you want to test. For example, using dynamic reconfigure in
      :class:`py_trees_ros.mock.battery.Battery` to abruptly force charging/discharging and at
      varying rates. Additionally, if you set up the mock well, you'll find it executes far faster
      than a full simulation (you can montage - no need to endure travel time).

      t will also make your web team happier (for apps that sit astride the behaiviour tree).
      These apps typically require thorough testing of decision making branches that are not
      often traversed e.g. battery low recovery handling, or cancelling procedures.
      This is far easier to do in a mock. They'll also appreciate not having to setup the
      entire infrastructure necessary for a dynamic simulation.
